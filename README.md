I think I'm done here for now, but other stuff I can do next:

* let user choose categories before starting game
* deactivate cards after they've been chosen
* have a scorebox that lets the user keep score for multiple players and keep track of turns etc (requires backend to persist)
* allow the user to create a custom game (requires backend)
